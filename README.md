How It Works
User Input
The user types a theme (e.g., "Fantasy") into a text box and clicks the Generate Names button.

Name Matching
The script looks for that theme in a predefined set of static name lists (inside JavaScript).

Fake AI Behavior

Shows a “🤖 Thinking...” message for 1.5 seconds to simulate processing

Randomly selects 5 names from the matched theme list

Displays the names in a list with a random "AI-style" comment

Regeneration
The user can click the Generate button again to get new random names for the same or different theme.

🧪 Technologies Used
HTML – For basic page structure

CSS – For styling (dark theme, buttons, layout)

JavaScript – For handling logic, theme matching, random name selection, and fake AI behavior

📦 How to Run the Project
Download the index.html file

Open it in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

Type a theme like "fantasy", "cute", or "tech"

Click "Generate Names"

Enjoy the results and try different themes!

🎯 Why I Built This
I wanted to build something:

That looks like it uses AI but is 100% front-end

Easy to understand and expand

A good starting point for learning real AI integration later

🧩 Future Ideas
Add sound effects when generating names

Store generated names in local storage

Let users download name results

Add real AI integration later using APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face

Feel free to copy or modify this README.md for your project. Would you like me to help create a GitHub version too?
